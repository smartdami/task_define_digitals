# task_define_digitals


Flutter Version : 3.24.3

I'm implementing MVVM architecture with Flutter BLoC to separate business logic from the UI. Notably, I’m not using any model classes in this task, as the project has minimal variables, so I decided to omit them.

Model: No models are involved.
View: Includes HomeScreen, Savings History Screen, Savings Entry Screen, Splash Screen, and Withdraw Screen.
ViewModel: Business logic is managed by BLoCs, which I’ve defined within the view models.
Additionally, routing and utilities are well-organized.
